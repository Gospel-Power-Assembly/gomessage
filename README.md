Our God is unlimited in his ways, His means, and resources. He can use anything or anyone to accomplish His purpose. In the past three weeks, we have been discussing God using angelic agents to intervene in the life of His people. Today we want to discuss God using human agents to meet the needs of His people God can use great men to help people of low status and can use little people to help people of high status.
There is no limit to who can use help you, or who he can use you to help. Whatever is your status or your station in life, God's help is coming your way.
God took away sleep from the king and made him restless all through the night, just for Mordecai the gate man to be promoted as the Prime Minister of his kingdom(Est.6-8). May God make the gatekeeper of your "throne" restless until you are "enthroned" in that place that heaven has ordained for you.
God uses people as agents to accomplish His purpose in the lives of others. God used a widow to feed Elijah throughout the season of famine in Israel (1 Kg 17:8-16). God used a slave girl to advise Naaman to visit the prophet in Israel for the cure of his leprosy (2 Kg 5:2-3). God used another servant to advise him to bathe in River Jordan for his healing (2 Kg 5:10-14) May God send you a human agent to bring solution to whatever challenges confronting you today God used the chief butler of Pharaoh to recommend Joseph to Pharaoh ( Gen 41:9-14).
God used Saul's servant to recommend Saul to Samuel (1Sam 9:5-10). God used Mordecai the gatekeeper to introduce Esther to the Palace (Est 2:5-11). God used one of Saul's servants to recommend David to King Saul (1 Sam 16:17-22).
May God ordain someone to introduce you to those that matter in your destiny. May God commission someone to recommend you to your destiny helpers. May you not wander aimlessly in the wilderness of life. May God orchestrate your path to meet with your God-ordained human agents to tum your story around in Jesus Name.
